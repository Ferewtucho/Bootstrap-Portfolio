                                    <p>I was born in the capital city of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. I moved to the United States in 2009 along with my parents and my younger sister.

                                        My parents made the decision to move to the United States in search of a better opportunity for their children. Once we moved to the United States there were many hardships in terms of the language barrier and finding a stable job to support the family.
                                        
                                        I took the responsibility of taking care of my younger sister and I chose to work instead of being fully invested in school.</p>
                             
                                    <p>Once I made the decision to go to college, I went to the Community College of Philadelphia to pursue nursing. I chose to pursue nursing as my major because I received many pressures from my family and I gave in. After two years in Community College, I got accepted at Jefferson, but the lack of interest that I had for this field, I wasnâ€™t motivated enough to pursue a field in nursing and continue studying this major. I decided to fully focus on my work as a zone manager at Paradise lagardere.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Now that my family is financially stable and more independent. I am taking this time to pursue my interest and for once in my life make a selfish move to go back to school and follow my dream as a web developer. </p>
